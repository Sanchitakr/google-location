# google-location
A curious kid who wanted to know why google asks to enable location wherever I go!

so I dig up some cool featured that google maps provide to trace your steps (if Hangover series happens in real life!)

recently found out about Google Takeout which exports a copy of the content in your Google Account to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google. 

step1: download Location history in JSON format from google takeout

step2: python code to convert JSON into latitudes and longitudes and save it as .kml file because google earth project takes .kml file as input

step3: In google earth (https://earth.google.com/web/) create a project. and import saved .kml file

step4: now (cue drum rolls).... following my footsteps(literally)

Tada!
